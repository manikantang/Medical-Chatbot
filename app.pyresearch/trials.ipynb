Neuropsychiatric disorders con-\\ntribute to approximately 13% of the global burden of disease and \\ncreate (to varying degrees among countries) burden in every coun-\\ntry in the world. \\nAssessments of mental health resources worldwide are done with \\nthe aim of shedding light on the most recent global view of re-\\nsources available to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders, provide \\nintervention, and protect human rights.  WHO reports of mental \\nhealth worldwide have examined resources with regard to geo-\\ngraphic region and economic status.  Categorizing countries into \\nregions is one way to organize the huge volume of information \\nabout mental health structures and services throughout the world.  \\nIn addition, looking at regions may be useful from an economic \\nperspective.  It has been established that many nations have no or \\nvery limited mental health programming and need to utilize the \\nsupport of other countries to develop a system of care.  Being in a \\nregion where a high percentage of neighboring countries have re-\\nsources can be useful for a country in the same area that has limita-\\ntions.  In addition, using the resources of a nation nearby may be \\nless expensive and a faster process than relying on resources from a \\nfar distance.'),\n",

Nevertheless, these studies are not \\nwithout their limitations.  \\n With regard to a discussion of mental health care by global re-\\ngion, data may be limited by the way regions have been catego-\\nrized.  In a report on global mental health (WHO, 2005) \\n“regions” are not necessarily divided precisely or purely by \\nglobal or physical location (i.e. a “region” may include countries \\nthat are not physically located on the same continent).  In some \\ncases, the “regional” similarity appears to be related to historical, \\ncultural, or economic factors that may link and make a group of \\ncountries comparable for analysis.  \\nOther limitations include an inability to obtain information from \\nall countries on all variables, variations in how different countries \\ndefine mental health concepts, and variations from country to \\ncountry in sources of information.'),\n",

Mental Health Capacity Building \\n27 \\nGUIDELINES FOR TEACHING PRIMARY HEALTHCARE \\nSTAFF TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE  \\nOne approach to training primary healthcare staff to provide men-\\ntal health care involves a) establishing learning goals and objec-\\ntives that are relevant and applicable to the existing practices of the \\nprimary care staff; b) developing theoretical mental health presen-\\ntations and practical on-the-job supervision sessions that are effec-\\ntive and convenient; and c) utilizing comprehensive evaluations to \\nmonitor and further enhance learning.  It is important that those \\nteaching have the appropriate level of education or experience in \\ntheir areas of instruction and that trainees have a basic level of \\nunderstanding that will allow them to comprehend the instruction.    \\n \\nA) Establishing Learning Goals & Objectives – What is the infor-\\nmation trainees are expected to learn? \\nObjectives may be defined as the learning needed to reach a par-\\nticular goal. Trainers must decide on the desired goal of their train-\\ning sessions and then develop clear objectives that will lead to the \\ngoal. \\nGoals and objectives need to be relevant or directly applicable to \\nthe real situations staff face in their primary care settings. \\nExample\\n: A goal of a mental health training course for a group of \\nprimary care doctors may be that they learn to provide an effective \\ntreatment for an individual with a particular mental health condi-\\ntion.  Objectives toward this goal may include their a) learning to \\ntake a psychiatric history; b) learning the varied signs and symp-\\ntoms of varied mental health conditions; and c) learning the varied \\ntypes of therapies to manage conditions.  A number of objectives \\nmay be involved in achieving an overall goal.'),\n",

Types of neurocognitive disorders include: 1)  \\ndelirium and 2) major & mild neurocognitive disorders \\n(dementia). \\n1) Delirium \\nDelirium is a disturbance particularly in the ability to focus, \\nsustain, or shift attention.  Other characteristics of delirium \\nmay include additional deficits in cognition (e.g. memory, \\nperception), rapid onset, a fluctuating course, reversiblility, \\nagitation,\\n irritability, and psychosis (i.e. distortion of reality).  \\nCauses of delirium may include brain disease, systemic dis-\\nease (e.g. heart disease), drugs, medications, and other tox-\\nins. \\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms of delirium may be identified \\nthrough a thorough mental status examination.  The underly-\\ning cause of disease may be identified, if resources are avail-\\nable, through a complete battery of laboratory and diagnostic \\ntests [e.g. blood chemistries, complete blood count, chest x-\\nray, urinalysis & toxicology, electrocardiogram (EKG), com-\\nputerized tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance im-\\naging of the brain].'),\n",

Emotional and Behavioral Problems \\n \\nA) Depression and anxiety \\nDepression and some anxiety disorders are common in the adult popu-\\nlation but occur with notable frequency in children as well.  Depres-\\nsion and anxiety may coexist and, as with other conditions, may be \\nexpressed differently from one individual to the next.  These condi-\\ntions may be expressed in behavior or other nonverbal expressions, \\nsince children are at an early stage in their emotional maturity.  A \\ndepressed child may appear sad, angry or agitated and may isolate \\nfrom others.  Children with anxiety, depression or a combination of \\nboth may also experience sleep problems or exhibit poor performance \\nin school. \\nManagement of depression or anxiety in children involves providing \\nsupport for the child and education for the family.  Antidepressant \\nmedications are not recommended for children (some medicines have \\nbeen shown to increase distress and ideas of suicide) and many short-\\nterm anti-anxiety medicines have potential for addiction.  Help the \\nchild and family identify the actions that may represent the distress \\nand help them to identify the circumstances in which these actions \\noccur.  Even though a child’s emotions are developing he or she can \\nstill be taught basic ways to verbalize distress.  Using simple cultur-\\nally appropriate picture charts showing different emotions and situa-\\ntions with which the child can identify, can be a way to begin discus-\\nsions about feelings.  Encourage the verbalization of distress.   Ver-\\nbalization can improve another’s (family, schoolmates, teachers) abil-\\nity to understand the child’s problem and provide a more effective \\nresponse.  Help the child recognize and understand that negative feel-\\nings such as anger and disappointment are natural human emotions \\nand that there are constructive ways to manage these emotions (i.e. \\nhelp the child to identify and anticipate difficult situations and teach \\nthe child a variety of healthy responses to the situations).'),\n",

Enuresis may occur \\nduring sleep or while awake. Enuresis causes a lot of stress and \\nshame for the child and can lead to more serious problem if not \\ntreated early.  A thorough psychiatric history, mental status exami-\\nnation with emphasis on the developmental history, medical his-\\ntory, and social environment is important. \\n \\nManagement of Enuresis\\n \\nA medical evaluation should be done to eliminate underlying \\nmedical causes for the problem. Be sure to assess for environ-\\nmental conditions  (e.g. if the wetting occurs during school time, is \\nit due to dirty toilets, or unavailable toilets at school?).  Also assess \\nfor other underlying psychological distress (e.g. the child who wets \\nthe bed may experience nightmares or night terrors and may be too \\nafraid to go to the toilet).'),\n",

Because of the serious nature and impact of GBV, the \\nsubject is addressed exclusively in this chapter.   \\nThe data on the prevalence and incidence of GBV in insecure set-\\ntings have limitations due to under-reporting of incidents.  Under-\\nreporting occurs for many reasons including fear of retaliation and \\nre-victimization, stigma, self blame, and mistrust of authorities.  \\nData available on GBV have indicated, a female victim and male \\nperpetrator are involved most frequently. While men and boys may \\nalso be vulnerable to sexual violence (particularly in situations of \\ntorture and detention ) the majority of survivors/victims of sexual \\nviolence have been females.   \\nBecause there is a tendency for under-reporting, it is important that \\nhealthcare staff working in unstable environments have an aware-\\nness and willingness to take constructive action when violence is \\nsuspected.

Specific types of GBV may vary across countries, re-\\ngions, and cultures and may include: a) domestic violence; b) \\nforced/early marriage; c) harmful traditional practices (e.g. female \\ngenital mutilation, honor killings, widow inheritance); d) traffick-\\ning; and e) sexual violence. \\n \\nRegarding sexual violence, it may be described as an unwanted, \\ndestructive sexual advance that is executed (e.g. as a sexual action) \\nor implied (e.g. as sexual verbal expression).  Studies have indi-\\ncated that power and control underlie the perpetration as opposed \\nto an amorous attraction or desire.  Forms of sexual violence seen \\nin insecure settings have included: rape (most often cited); at-\\ntempted assaults; verbal sexual threats and humiliating comments; \\nmolestation or repeated unwanted advances; domestic violence \\ntoward a spouse; and incest toward a  family relative. \\n \\nReports have indicated that groups associated with GBV perpetra-\\ntion in insecure settings may include fellow refugees; other clan \\nmembers; religious or ethnic groups; military personnel; relief \\nworkers; and family members.

If there is anti-retroviral \\nmedication in the system but not at a level to effectively disable the virus, \\nthe virus can potentially mutate or change to a form that can resist the effects \\nof the medication.  This capacity to change and resist medication effects is \\ntermed resistance.  Resistance is an important reason why HIV drugs stop \\nworking.  Missed doses of medication or continuing on a drug regimen that \\nis not effective can encourage resistance.  Interactions with other medicines \\nthat reduce HIV medication in the system or a poor ability to absorb HIV \\nmedication into the bloodstream can also contribute to resistance.   \\n \\n \\nAdherence \\n \\n \\nThe risk of resistance may be reduced by maintaining adherence to the anti-\\nretroviral medicines prescribed.  Adherence, in simple terms, means the abil-\\nity to take medications as prescribed.  Specifically, adherence involves a) \\ntaking the appropriate anti-retroviral drugs; b) taking the drugs on the appro-\\npriate schedule; and c) taking the drugs in the correct manner (e.g. with or \\nwithout food).  One hundred percent adherence is required for treatment to \\nbe effective.  With precise adherence, antiretroviral therapy will be success-\\nful.  With poor adherence continued viral replication and increased viral load \\nmay occur, the CD4+ T cell count may decrease (increasing the risk for op-\\nportunistic infections), and the potential for resistance may emerge.  It can \\nbe challenging for individuals to maintain 100% adherence.  Adherence \\ncounselling provides those with difficulty support and techniques to improve \\nand maintain adherence.

Ob-\\nservation (e.g. viewing for tremors, drooling, stooped posture, and \\na shuffling walking pattern) and physical examination ( e.g. flexing \\nthe elbow joints and feeling the arm muscles for tightness or rigid-\\nity) are ways to detect symptoms.  Studies (western research) indi-\\ncate that EPS is more common with high potency typical antipsy-\\nchotics (e.g. haloperidol and fluphenazine) than with low potency \\nantipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine).  High \\ndoses of antipsychotic medication are associated with an increased \\nrisk for EPS.

EPS typically occur within the first 4 weeks \\nof antipsychotic use and are reversible\\n with  discontinuation of the \\ndrug.  Symptoms may disappear within days to months after antip-\\nsychotic medication has been stopped. If a patient needs to remain \\non medication to control severe psychotic symptoms, EPS may be \\nreduced with anticholinergic medicines such as trihexyphenidyl or \\ndiphenhydramine and, for akathisia specifically, propanolol and \\nbenzodiazepines (i.e. diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam).'),\n",
